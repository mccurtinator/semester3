# BashBook 2
## Tomasz Gruca, Michael Mc Curtin

BashBook 2, an updated version of *BashBook*, allows multiple users to connect to the BashBook server at the same time.

The server admin must first start the server by typing "./server.sh".

Each user has been assigned their own ID.

To log in and create your user profile:
1. Type "./client.sh *userID*". 
2. Type "create".

This will create your user directory.

To add another user to your friends list, type "add *friendID*".

## Walls

To make a post on your friend's wall, type "post *friendID* *message*". Note that your friend must also have added you to their friends list for the message to be posted.

To display a user's wall, type "display *userID*".

### Happy bashing!
